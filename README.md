# timeseries
The second project requires us to simulate three tables in the page 336-338 for book 《高等时间序列计量经济学》. 
Based on functional analysis method, we obtain the limiting distribution for the three test statistics discussed, which are all functions of wiener process. 
Therefore, I use different functions of wiener process to simulate the three test statistics. This is also the main innovation for the project. 
Rmd code shown in ts_hw2.rmd and report shown in ts_hw2.html.
